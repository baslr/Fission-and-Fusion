## Credits and Thanks
* **Roxor128**: for the initial outlines of much of the fusion technology.
* **GotLag**: for inspiration from the Reactors mod and kind permission to use the Reactor Interface logic.
* **Klonan**: for the KS Power mod, which taught me some power generation tricks.
* **Arch666Angel**: for the fusion reactor sprite, taken from the thread of discarded art.
* **Sirenfal**: for help and patience while I was taking my first steps as a Factorio modder.
* **Arumba**: for getting me interested in Factorio in the first place via his videos.
