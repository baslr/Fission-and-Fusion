## Credits
* **Roxor128**: for the initial outlines of much of the fusion technology.
* **GotLag**: for the Reactors mod which inspired the radioisotope/RTG tech.
* **Klonan**: for the KS Power mod, which taught me some power generation tricks.
* **Arch666Angel**: for the thread of freely provided images from which the fusion reactor sprite was taken.
* **Sirenfal**: for help and patience while I was taking my first steps as a Factorio modder.
* **Arumba**: for getting me interested in Factorio in the first place via his videos.
