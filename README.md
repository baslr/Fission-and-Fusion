## Current Integrations with Other Mods
* [Nuclear Fuel](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/GotLag/Nuclear%20Fuel) by GotLag
  * Add radioisotope chance to plutonium fuel reprocessing
  * Add plutonium chance to portable uranium cell reprocessing
  * Add portable plutonium cells and reprocessing for them
  * Add portable MOX cell recipe
* [Angel's Petro Chemical Processing](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Arch666Angel/angelspetrochem) by Arch666Angel
  * Change heavy water hydrogen sulfide exchange recipe to use Angel's hydrogen sulfide
  * Change deuterium electrolysis recipe to use Angel's electrolysers and create oxygen as a byproduct

## Future Possibilities
* Upgraded graphics
  * I've started [a request thread](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=46417) in the Factorio Texture Packs forum should anyone with artistic skill feel inspired.
* Bob's integrations
  * I do not play with Bob's mods myself, so I'd need input and recipe ideas from people who do.

## Code Attribution
* Fusion reactor interface logic: adapted from GotLag's [Reactor Interface](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/GotLag/Reactor%20Interface) mod.
* Fusion generator self-heating logic: adapted from the diesel generator in Klonan's [KS Power](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Klonan/KS_Power) mod.

* The portable fuel cell icons, their depleted variants, the deuterium pellets icon, and the temperature icon were assembled by Undarl from public domain images.
* The gas-deuterium, liquid-heavy-water, and reprocess-portable-uranium-cell icons were created from Factorio game assets modified and combined with public domain images.
* The radioisotopes icon is a color-shifted variant of the Factorio U-235 game asset.
* The reprocess-portable-breeder-cell icon was assembled by Undarl from public domain images and the plutonium icon graphic from GotLag's [Nuclear Fuel](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/GotLag/Nuclear%20Fuel) mod.
