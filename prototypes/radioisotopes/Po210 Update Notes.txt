A full Factorio day/night cycle is 25000 ticks, ~7mins.

Looking at degrading RTG performance by 5% per day, which would
give them a total of around 2.3hrs of useful life.

Possible settings to choose number of days per degradation.

21 item-entity pairs: one empty, one full, 5-95% by fives.

Creation function that adds new RTGs to global table: entity, depletion state,
ticks in state, equipmentgrid. Runs on place and place equipment events.

Update function that runs every 60ticks/1sec and updates global
RTG tables. If ticks are >= 25000 (or setting) then update depletion state,
reset ticks in state, swap entity for new entity. Else increment ticks in state.

Destruction function that nulls global RTG table entries. Runs on mine and
remove equipment events.

Assembler recipe to deconstruct RTG arrays into 14 RTGs and 50% or so of other
used components.
