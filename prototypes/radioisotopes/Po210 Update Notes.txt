Change current RTGs to 1x2 items that put out 30kW forever, change RTG array
to require 10 of them and output 300kW.
==DONE.

New Po210-style RTGs put out 80kW at 1x2 size, but lose 5% output per game day
until they bottom out at 10% (8kW). That takes about 2 hours of play. They will
stay there forever, or can be reprocessed for material returns.

A full Factorio day/night cycle is 25000 ticks, ~7mins. The cycle from full to
10% by 5% increments takes 18 days, or ~2hrs6mins real time.

19 item-entity pairs: one full, 95%-10% by fives.

Creation function that adds new RTGs to global table: entity, depletion state,
ticks in state, equipmentgrid. Runs on place equipment events.

Update function that runs every 60ticks/1sec and updates global
RTG tables. If ticks are >= 25000 (or setting) then update depletion state,
reset ticks in state, swap entity for new entity. Else increment ticks in state.

Destruction function that nulls global RTG table entries. Runs on remove
equipment events.

Assembler recipe to deconstruct RTGs into percentage of used components
less radioisotopes. Setting-based: 0/25/50/75, default 50.

Create alternate version of RTG graphic for Po210 units.
